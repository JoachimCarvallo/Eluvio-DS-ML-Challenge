# Eluvio DS & ML Challenge

### Context : 
The dataset is tabular and the features involved should be self-explanatory. We would like for you to come up with a specific problem yourself and solve it properly. This is an “open challenge,” mainly focusing on natural language processing. The problem could be either about predictive modeling or providing analytical insights for some business use cases. Note the problem should be treated as large-scale, as the dataset is large (e.g., >100GB) and will not fit into the RAM of your machine. Python is strongly recommended in terms of the coding language.

For the timeline, we would suggest 1-2 weeks as a guideline to finish the challenge. But time is not the first priority that we consider during our evaluation; we focus foremost on the work quality and we know you may have many competing priorities! So please use your time well to demonstrate to the best of your ability.

### Documents:


The main element of this work is a jupyter notebook: 'Eluvio_DS_&_ML_Challenge.ipynb'. You will also find in the tab "Intermediate backups and data", the data of the challenge, as well as some intermediate backup files.
